### Teck Stack:

- <b>Frontend</b>: React Native
- <b>Programming Language</b>: TypeScript
- <b>Backend</b>: Appwrite
- <b>UI</b>: TailwindCSS

### Objective

This practice project involves rebuilding a mobile app using React Native and TypeScript, based on the tutorial <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCUegTZF7M" target="blank"> Build a Full Stack React Native App <a>

The resource primarily demostrates building a React Native App using JavaScript. My job is to convert the JavaScript into TypeScript for it's advantage.

### Advantages of TypeScript

1. **Static Typing**

   - Detects type-related errors at compile time, reducing runtime bugs.
   - Provides a clear contract for functions, classes, and variables.

2. **Improved Code Readability and Maintainability**

   - Makes the code self-documenting with explicit types.
   - Easier for teams to understand, refactor, and maintain codebases.

3. **Better Tooling Support**

   - Enhanced IntelliSense in IDEs for autocompletion, parameter hints, and code navigation.
   - Strong integration with popular editors like Visual Studio Code.

4. **Early Bug Detection**

   - Catches potential issues during development instead of runtime.
   - Reduces debugging time and ensures more reliable applications.

5. **Improved Collaboration**

   - Helps developers understand how to use components or functions without delving into the implementation.
   - Makes onboarding new developers easier.

6. **Supports Modern JavaScript Features**

   - Includes ES6/ESNext features with backward compatibility.
   - Allows writing modern, future-proof code that compiles to older JavaScript versions if needed.

7. **Extensive Ecosystem**

   - Seamlessly integrates with JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
   - Offers type definitions for popular libraries through **DefinitelyTyped**.

8. **Scalability**

   - Ideal for large-scale applications where robust typing helps manage complex codebases.

9. **Optional Typing**

   - Incrementally adopt TypeScript in JavaScript projects without fully migrating.
